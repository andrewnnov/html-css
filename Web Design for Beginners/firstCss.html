		<p>This is the main area (or column). When we think about how the very different experiences in the
three dream reports were brought about, and even what they may
mean, we can easily understand the first two simply in terms of
brain activation that reflects, in sleep, the dreamer’s previous
experience (the boat trip) and concerns about the future (anxiety
about an exam). In both cases, the residual brain activation of sleep
onset and early night sleep is enough to reproduce faithfully a very
small part of waking experience. Report 3, however, needs a much
more elaborate explanation to account for its description of events,
many of which never happened and never could have happened.
Brain activation, which must be powerful, and highly selective, can
account for some aspects – the hallucinatory imagery and the
associated movements, for example. But activation cannot account
for the bizarreness and the loss of logical reasoning.</p>
